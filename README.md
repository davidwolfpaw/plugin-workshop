### How to use this repo
Follow along with the [first commit](https://github.com/davidwolfpaw/plugin-workshop/commits/master) at the bottom of the page, and move your way up through the commits. Each one is a step in the process of learning general plugin making concepts.

### Some of the things that we demonstrate:

* Adding a submenu item to an existing menu in the WordPress dashboard
* Rendering a settings page
* Creating a settings section, fields, and registering the fields with the Settings API
* Creating a header for the settings section
* Creating functions that render radio buttons and textareas
* Using a hook to dipslay our notification bar
* Enqueuing a stylesheet
* Adding settings to the Customizer using the Customizer API
